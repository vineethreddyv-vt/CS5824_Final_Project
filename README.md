# CS5824_Final_Project

## FramworkForPredAndRet.ipynb
- This framework loads a pre-trained model
- Prepeares the data set for feature extraction
- Perfoms image classification and retrieval 

Need to replace path for model and dataset to run this notebook

## ModelDesignAndTrain.ipynb
- This notebook is where we built the custom CNN model, trained and saved the model

Need to replace path for dataset to run this notebook

## TransferTrainAndSaveModels.ipynb
- This notebook is for transfer learning
- This loads a pre-trained VGG model and then makes some modifications to the model
- Trains the model with dataset

Need to replace path dor dataset to run this notebook

##Link to Dataset and Saved Models
- CustomeCNNModel.h5 is the trained saved model that we built
- TransferVGG.h5 is the trained saved model built on VGG
- It also has the dataset prepared for the museum art use case
